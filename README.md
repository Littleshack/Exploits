# Exploits

I have been asked to remove the exploit until further notice. 

I have removed the exploit.

The exploit was for Atos' (www.atos.net) "Dyamon" agent, version 2.37 and earlier.  If your business is using the Dyamon Agent (also known as R3D3 [R3D3_Agent.exe]), request the version number on your systems, and ask to be updated if you are on 2.37 or earlier.
